### Initial partitioning and formating the drive with zfs <a name="inital"></a>

---

- full credit to https://github.com/mcdonc/p51-thinkpad-nixos/blob/zfsvid/README.rst

- Partition and format the drive:

- `sudo sgdisk --zap-all /dev/nvme0n1`

- `sudo fdisk /dev/nvme0n1`, then:

```bash
  g
  n
  accept default part num
  accept default first sector
  last sector: +2G
  t
  use partiton type 1 (EFI System)
  n
  accept default partition number
  accept default first sector
  accept default last sector
  w
```

- No swap partition (huge amount of memory, also security)

- Create the boot volume:

```bash
  sudo mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/nvme0n1p1
  sudo fatlabel /dev/nvme0n1p1 NIXBOOT
```

- Create a zpool:

```bash
  sudo zpool create -f \
   -o altroot="/mnt" \
   -o ashift=12 \
   -o autotrim=on \
   -O compression=lz4 \
   -O acltype=posixacl \
   -O xattr=sa \
   -O relatime=on \
   -O normalization=formD \
   -O dnodesize=auto \
   -O sync=disabled \
   -O encryption=aes-256-gcm \
   -O keylocation=prompt \
   -O keyformat=passphrase \
   -O mountpoint=none \
   NIXROOT \
   /dev/nvme0n1p2
```

- Create zfs volumes::

```bash
  sudo zfs create -o mountpoint=legacy NIXROOT/root
  sudo zfs create -o mountpoint=legacy NIXROOT/home
  # reserved to cope with running out of disk space
  sudo zfs create -o refreservation=1G -o mountpoint=none NIXROOT/reserved
```

- `sudo mount -t zfs NIXROOT/root /mnt`
- Mount subvolumes:

```bash
  sudo mkdir /mnt/boot
  sudo mkdir /mnt/home
  sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot
  sudo mount -t zfs NIXROOT/home /mnt/home
```
- installing nixos (if on live-usb and eg connected via ssh)

```bash
sudo nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
# make sure hardware-configuration.nix contains the right device by-uuid
#### skip step below if you want to keep old hostid, in case u want to import previously existing zpool (which is already accessed by previous hostid)
head -c 8 /etc/machine-id
# copy the value to configuration.nix to  networking.hostId = "xxxxxxxx";
# with the updated configuration.nix and hardware-configuration.nix copy or pull the remaining nixos config
sudo nixos-install --flake .#flake
```

- setting up sops-nix if reinstalling

a reboot seems to be necesarry to generate `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub`, then:

```bash
nix-shell -p ssh-to-age --run 'cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub | ssh-to-age'
# copy age-key to /etc/nixos/.sops.yaml
sops updatekeys secrets/main.yaml.yaml # on a system with a working age-key to add the new one to 
# copy both files to new host
```

### Setup of hdds <a name="hdds"></a>

---

```bash
sudo zpool create tank raidz1 sdb sdc sdd -O compression=lz4  -o autotrim=on -O encryp
tion=aes-256-gcm -O keylocation=prompt  -O keyformat=passphrase
```

### Sanoid and Syncoid <a name="Sanoid"></a>

---

fully based on: https://github.com/mcdonc/.nixconfig/blob/master/videos/zfsremotebackups/script.rst

backup target is home-server (omhe) and backup source is eg desktop (rainbow, with data to be backed up).

prerequisites:

- ssh key passphraseless generated via `ssh-keygen` and then deployed via sops:

```nix
# hosts/omhe/sanoid-backup-target.nix

sops.secrets."ssh/keys/backup" = {
      mode = "0600";
      path = "/var/lib/syncoid/backup"; # key need to be on this location, if this directory doesnt exist yet: i think it gets created when syncoid is either installed or maybe when it attempts to sync at least one source
      owner = "syncoid"; # key is for the syncoid user, if this is not set there are permission issues
    };
```

- on the source machine (rainbow) set up a backup user:

```nix
# hosts/rainbow/sanoid-backup-source.nix

  users.users.backup = {
    isNormalUser = true;
    createHome = false;
    home = "/var/empty";
    extraGroups = [ ];
    openssh = {
      authorizedKeys.keys = [
        ''ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMg2AFhpk8nsyxXSRLnSaEWXDQFQzCEsw+TsQsK/Hi9U fschn@rainbow''
      ];
    };
  };
```

- On your source system (rainbow), give some ZFS permissions to the backup user on the dataset that you want to back up. These are necessary for syncoid to do its job:

```bash
sudo zfs allow backup compression,hold,send,snapshot,mount,destroy NIXROOT/home
```

- for backup target (omhe):

```nix
# hosts/omhe/configuration.nix

# dont ask for "tank/rainbow-backup" credentials at boot, but have tank pool key loaded
boot.zfs.requestEncryptionCredentials = lib.mkForce [ "NIXROOT" "tank"];
```

- Finally on the target system(omhe) configure a `services.syncoid` to pull from the source system dataset `NIXROOT/home` in `hosts/omhe/sanoid-backup-target.nix`, and a 'services.sanoid' to keep around historical snapshots. The dataset I'm backing up to is 'tank/rainbow-backup' and this can not exist before syncoid and sanoid services inital run as they create it automatically and throw an error otherwise.

- On the source system (rainbow), configure a `services.sanoid` in `hosts/rainbow/sanoid-backup-source.nix` to keep around a few historical datasets.

### Nextcloud <a name="Nextcloud"></a>

---

- prerequesite for `home = "/tank/Nextcloud";` :

```bash
sudo zfs create tank/Nextcloud
sudo zfs set mountpoint=/tank/Nextcloud tank/Nextcloud
sudo chown nextcloud:nextcloud /tank/Nextcloud/
```

- to avoid `nexcould version is marked insecure` error, specify nextcloud package:

```nix
    services.nextcloud.package = pkgs.nextcloud29;
```

- prometheus nextcloud-exporter prerequesite:

```bash
# Generate random value (for example using openssl)
TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
# Set token (using the occ console application)
nextcloud-occ config:app:set serverinfo token --value "$TOKEN"
```

- ONLYOFFICE DocumentServer:

```nix

  services.onlyoffice = {
    enable = true;
    jwtSecretFile = config.sops.secrets."onlyoffice/jwtSecretFile".path;
    hostname = "office.fschn.org";
  };

  # reverse proxy
  services.nginx = {
    virtualHosts.${config.services.onlyoffice.hostname} = {
      useACMEHost = "fschn.org";
      forceSSL = true;
    };
  };

  # secret deployment
  sops.secrets."onlyoffice/jwtSecretFile" = {
    owner = "onlyoffice";
  };
```



Then point nextcloud to the document server from within the Nextcloud UI ("Administration Settings" -> Administration -> ONLYOFFICE), and make sure the 'services.onlyoffice.jwtSecretFile points to a file containing the same key as entered in the configuration of the Nextcloud app. 

Also needed to change the port of scrutiny from 8080 to 8081, as somehow the onlyoffice documentserver needs the 8080 port.


- nextcloud logs dashbaord with loki and promtail

extra nextcloud settings:
```nix
services.nextcloud.settings = {
      loglevel = 1;
      log_type = "file";
      logfile = "/tank/Nextcloud/data/nextcloud.log";
      log_type_audit = "file";
      logfile_audit = "/tank/Nextcloud/data/audit.log";
    };
```

add following scrape_config to `services.promtail.configuration`:
```nix
  {         
     job_name = "system";
    static_configs = [{
      targets = [ "${toString config.tailnet.omhe}" ];
      labels = {
        instance = "nextcloud.fschn.org";
        env = "home-lab";
        job = "nextcloud";
        __path__ = "/tank/Nextcloud/data/{nextcloud,audit}.log";
      };
    }];
  };
```

and give the necesary permissions for the promtail user with:
```nix
 users.users.promtail.extraGroups = [ "nextcloud" ];
```

- first login with user `root` (which is the default value of `services.nextcloud.config.adminuser`) and password as set with `services.nextcloud.config.adminpassFile`.

### Auto unlock gnome keyring <a name="keyring"></a>

---

needed for protonmail-bridge and nextclould-client. First:

```nix
# modules/gnome.nix

  services.gnome.gnome-keyring.enable = true;
  security.pam.services.gdm.enableGnomeKeyring = true;
  programs.seahorse.enable = true; # installing gui
```

Then based on this [reddit.com reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/1c225c8/gnome_keyring_is_not_unlocked_upon_boot/?rdt=40009):

> This is extremely non obvious, but if you want to have autologin unlock your gnome keyring on startup, the keyring needs to have a blank password.
>
> I actually don't remember where I read this, I just have this as a comment in my config. I do remember spending hours trying to figure out wtf it wasn't working though.
>
> I can't speak to the security implications of this. I autologin on my laptop, because my "login" is the ZFS passphrase prompt to decrypt the drives, so that isn't really a concern for me.

Changing the keyring password with seahorse to blank, and voil√† it works.

### Jellyfin <a name="jellyfin"></a>

---

prerequiste for `jellyfin.dataDir`:
```bash
sudo zfs create /tank/Jellyfin
sudo chown jellyfin:jellyfin /tank/Jellyfin
```

adding a plugin, via jellyfin web-ui: 

```bash
# admin-dashboard > plugins > repositories
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intro-skipper/intro-skipper/master/manifest.json
```
### Deluge <a name="deluge"></a>

---

prerequiste for `deluge.dataDir`:
```bash
sudo zfs create /tank/Deluge
```

Setting up deluge in a sperate network namespace with only a wireguard vpn interface:

First, creating network namespace with wireguard vpn interface based on this [tutorual](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/setting-up-wireguard-in-a-network-namespace-for-selectively-routing-traffic-through-vpn/10252/8):

```nix
  # VPN wireguard conf file
  sops.secrets."Deluge/vpn.conf" = { };
  sops.secrets."Deluge/vpn-ip4addr-cidr" = { };

  # creating network namespace
  systemd.services."netns@" = {
    description = "%I network namespace";
    before = [ "network.target" ];
    serviceConfig = {
      Type = "oneshot";
      RemainAfterExit = true;
      ExecStart = "${pkgs.iproute2}/bin/ip netns add %I";
      ExecStop = "${pkgs.iproute2}/bin/ip netns del %I";
    };
  };

  # setting up wireguard interafe within network namespace
  systemd.services.wg = {
    description = "wg network interface";
    bindsTo = [ "netns@wg.service" ];
    requires = [ "network-online.target" ];
    after = [ "netns@wg.service" ];
    serviceConfig = {
      Type = "oneshot";
      RemainAfterExit = true;
      ExecStart = with pkgs; writers.writeBash "wg-up" ''
        see -e
        ${iproute2}/bin/ip link add wg0 type wireguard
        ${iproute2}/bin/ip link set wg0 netns wg
        ${iproute2}/bin/ip -n wg address add ${toString config.sops.secrets."Deluge/vpn-ip4addr-cidr".path} dev wg0
        # ${iproute2}/bin/ip -n wg -6 address add <ipv6 VPN addr/cidr> dev wg0
        ${iproute2}/bin/ip netns exec wg \
          ${wireguard-tools}/bin/wg setconf wg0 ${toString config.sops.secrets."Deluge/vpn.conf".path}
        ${iproute2}/bin/ip -n wg link set wg0 up
        # need to set lo up as network namespace is started with lo down
        ${iproute2}/bin/ip -n wg link set lo up
        ${iproute2}/bin/ip -n wg route add default dev wg0
        # ${iproute2}/bin/ip -n wg -6 route add default dev wg0
      '';
      ExecStop = with pkgs; writers.writeBash "wg-down" ''
        ${iproute2}/bin/ip -n wg route del default dev wg0
        # ${iproute2}/bin/ip -n wg -6 route del default dev wg0
        ${iproute2}/bin/ip -n wg link del wg0
      '';
    };
  };
```

Second, binding deluged to newly created network namespace and enabling connectivity of delugeweb (in root namespace) to delguded in seperate network namespace, based on this [tutorial](https://github.com/existentialtype/deluge-namespaced-wireguard):
```nix
  # binding deluged to network namespace
  systemd.services.deluged.bindsTo = [ "netns@wg.service" ];
  systemd.services.deluged.requires = [ "network-online.target" "wg.service" ];
  systemd.services.deluged.serviceConfig.NetworkNamespacePath = [ "/var/run/netns/wg" ];

  # allowing delugeweb to access deluged in network namespace, a socket is necesarry 
  systemd.sockets."proxy-to-deluged" = {
    enable = true;
    description = "Socket for Proxy to Deluge Daemon";
    listenStreams = [ "58846" ];
    wantedBy = [ "sockets.target" ];
  };

  # creating proxy service on socket, which forwards the same port from the root namespace to the isolated namespace
  systemd.services."proxy-to-deluged" = {
    enable = true;
    description = "Proxy to Deluge Daemon in Network Namespace";
    requires = [ "deluged.service" "proxy-to-deluged.socket" ];
    after = [ "deluged.service" "proxy-to-deluged.socket" ];
    unitConfig = { JoinsNamespaceOf = "deluged.service"; };
    serviceConfig = {
      User = "deluge";
      Group = "deluge";
      ExecStart = "${pkgs.systemd}/lib/systemd/systemd-socket-proxyd --exit-idle-time=5min 127.0.0.1:58846";
      PrivateNetwork = "yes";
    };
  };
```


### Firefox-syncserver <a name="firefox-syncserver"></a>

---

Navigate to **about:config** in your Firefox address bar and set **identity.sync.tokenserver.uri** to **https://ffsync.fschn.org/1.0/sync/1.5**.

On Firefox android go to Settings > About Firefox and tap the logo a bunch, it will enable a few hidden options back on the main Settings page. One of which should be custom Sync and Firefox Accound settings.

### Syncthing <a name="syncthing"></a>

---

needs to be run as as system user to avoid permission issues. thus:

```nix
  services.syncthing = {
    user = "fschn";
    group = "users";
    };
```

### Paperless <a name="paperless"></a>

---

as prerequisite for Paperless:
```bash
sudo zfs create tank/Paperless
sudo chown -R fschn:users /tank/Paperless
```
### Immich <a name="immich"></a>

---

as prerequisite for Immich:
```bash
sudo zfs create tank/Photos
sudo chown -R fschn:users /tank/Photos
```

added photos folder from rainbow host to be synced in syncthing.nix

add `/tank/Photos` as external library in immich admin web gui.

### Citrix <a name="citrix"></a>

---

First downlaoded the tar.gz installation file from the citrix homepage, getting the correct version is important. then `nix-prefetch-url file://$PWD/linuxx64-22.12.0.12.tar.gz`, again with the correct version.

### Adding VPNs <a name="vpn"></a>

---

still a somewhat clumsy and manual process, first download example.conf file from eg proton or other vpn provider then:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection import type wireguard file ~/Downloads/example.conf                                                                                               Tue 15 Apr 2025 04:00:30 PM CEST
sudo cat /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/example.nmconnection ## ctrl + c output

# then manually add with
cd /etc/nixos/
sops secrets/main.yaml ## and ctrl + v to relevant section
```

### Auto unlocking gnome keyring <a name="keyring"></a>

---


If changing to a blank password of the current keyring doesnt work, creating a new keyring with a blank password (while keeping the old one with all entries) seems to do the trick.


### Switching bootloader from Grub to systemd-boot <a name="bootloader"></a> 

---


- could not find any previously installed systemd-boot

run `sudo bootctl install`

- not enough space on /boot

based on this [discourse.nixos.org repy](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/what-to-do-with-a-full-boot-partition/2049/11?u=fschn90):

> 1.  Do a sudo nixos-rebuild build so that you‚Äôre sure that the build of your current configuration can be carried out
> 2.  Do a garbage collection to remove old system generations with sudo nix-collect-garbage -d
> 3.  Manually make some space in boot. Find your kernels and rm them.
> 4.  Run sudo nixos-rebuild switch or sudo nixos-rebuild boot. This time your bootloader will be installed correctly along with the new kernel and initrd
> 5.  Make sure point 4 was executed correctly by looking at the output and reboot
> 6.  [optional] remove the result directory created by point 1


### Nextcloud reinstallation <a name="nextcloud"></a>

---


After manually removing nextcloud data and rebuilding, with e.g.:

```bash
zfs destroy tank/Nextcloud
## or rename to keep files (not database tho) as backup
zfs rename tank/Nextcloud tank/Nextcloud-old
## the recreate nextcloud home
zfs create tank/Nextcloud
sudo zfs set mountpoint=/tank/Nextcloud tank/Nextcloud
# make sure the nextcloud user owns the dir
sudo chown nextcloud:nextcloud /tank/Nextcloud/
# drop the old database for fresh restart
sudo -u postgres dropdb nextcloud
nixos-rebuild switch
```

- the user already exisits error

renaming the admin user with `services.nextcloud.config.adminuser` to another value does work. probably the previous user is kept in the cache despite delete the whole filesystem. also deleteing the old users in the nextcloud interface ensures not running out of names eventually. idea: maybe needs to remove user from database


### Grafana <a name="grafana-trouble"></a>

---


1. to avoid `provisioned dashboard cannot be deleted / saved`, the followgin needs to be edited:

```nix

  environment.etc = {
    "grafana-dashboards/node-exporter-full_rev37.json" = {
      source = ./dashboards/node-exporter-full_rev37.json;
      group = "grafana";
      user = "grafana";
    };
  };
```

but also, when adding a new dashboard it needs to be imported manually with the grafana web interface and then exported as json first, and only then to be added to the config via the above code. this adds the specific datasource uid to the json.

2. Node Exporter Dashboard graphs, displaying `no data` when selecting time range smaller than 24h. 
Because the dashboard is expecting prometheus to scrape every 15s.

### Firefox-syncserver <a name="syncserver"></a>

---


To view logs, type [about:sync-log](about:sync-log) into firefox address bar.

Logging out of mozilla account in firefox seemed to sometimes solve connection errors.
Especially when rebuilding firefox-syncserver with a new hostname it seemed to be necesarry.

To avoid error `findCluster has a pre-existing clusterURL, so fetching new token`.
In the firefox address bar type about:profiles.
Then in the profile dir, delete `weave` dir, firefox-sync used to be formerly named Weave.

From [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34674569), even though not relevant yet:
> sometimes the first sync times out when you have a larger data set, and you need to manually enable each sync type to reduce the size. But once it's up and running, I don't really have any issues.

### Deluge in network namespace with wireguard vpn <a name="deluge-netns"></a>

---

first rebuild switch failed with `Failed to open network namespace path /var/run/netns/wg: No such file or directory`, solved then with:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart deluged
```

also delugeweb failed with `Dependency failed for Deluge BitTorrent WebUI.`, solved then with:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart delugeweb
```


How to get magnet links into deluge web client: use the firefox extention `Torrent to Web`.

### Jellyfin <a name="jellerror"></a>

---

`Error displaying media content` for all media files, then this helped:
```bash
mv /var/cache/jellyfin /var/cache/jellyfin-bak
mv /tank/Jellyfin/config /tank/Jellyfin/config-bak
sudo systemctl restart jellyfin
```

didnt remove metadata in fact.

### sops-nix <a name="sops-nix-trouble"></a>

---

```bash
$ sops secrets/main.yaml
Failed to get the data key required to decrypt the SOPS file.
```

then moste likely forgot to add the age key for user. if thats the case then:
```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/sops/age
$ nix-shell -p ssh-to-age --run "ssh-to-age -private-key -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 > ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt"
```

### Stable Diffusion with AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT <a name="stable-diffusion"></a>

---

standard installation proccess:
```bash
mkdir ai
cd ai

git clone git@github.com:AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git
cd stable-diffusion-webui/
nix-shell --argstr variant ROCM
./webui.sh
```

however, this fails with following msg:

$zpool status                                                                                                                                        Tue 08 Jul 2025 12:42:21 PM UTC
  pool: NIXROOT
 state: ONLINE
status: Mismatch between pool hostid and system hostid on imported pool.
        This pool was previously imported into a system with a different hostid,
        and then was verbatim imported into this system.
action: Export this pool on all systems on which it is imported.
        Then import it to correct the mismatch.
   see: https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/msg/ZFS-8000-EY
config:

        NAME                            STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        NIXROOT                         ONLINE       0     0     0
          wwn-0x5001b448c9392e80-part2  ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: No known data errors
```

in this case the following to solve by making changes of host id to zpool persistent:

```bash
zpool set multihost=on NIXROOT
zpool set multihost=off NIXROOT
zpool status NIXROOT
```

### Immich restore database from backup <a name="restore-immichdb"></a>

Entirely based [on](https://gist.github.com/V3ntus/8f28c7965c085bb99a9b51904ebd8248) from [V3ntus](https://gist.github.com/V3ntus).

Lost the postgres database due to a faily drive but had mediaLocation in tackt including backups.

1. Stop Immich

```bash
sudo systemctl stop immich-server.service immich-machine-learning.service
```

2. Get and prepare backup (which immich hopefully created)

```bash
# moving file to to location which is readable by postgres user, extracting it and making sure it is readable
sudo cp -p /tank/Immich/backups/immich-db-backup.sql.gz /var/lib/postgresql/
sudo gunzip /var/lib/postgresql/immich-db-backup.sql.gz
sudo chown postgres:postgres /var/lib/postgresql/immich-db-backup.sql.gz
```

3. Prepare database

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql immich
immich=# <paste following codeblock and exit>
```
```sql
DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
DROP SCHEMA vectors CASCADE;

CREATE SCHEMA public;

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS unaccent;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vectors;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS cube;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS earthdistance;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;

ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO immich;
ALTER SCHEMA vectors OWNER TO immich;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE pg_vector_index_stat TO immich;

ALTER EXTENSION vectors UPDATE;
```

4. Import the backup

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql immich -f /var/lib/postgresql/immich-db-backup.sql.gz
```

5. Start Immich

```bash
sudo systemctl start immich-server.service immich-machine-learning.service
```
